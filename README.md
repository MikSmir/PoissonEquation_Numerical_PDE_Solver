# PoissonEquation_Numerical_PDE_Solver
This code was part of a project for a Computational Analysis Class, where the task was to numerically solve a partial differential equation (Poisson Equation) boundary value problem. This was solved in both Mathematica and MATLAB using the finite difference method over a grid.
